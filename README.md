# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

TODO:

- Choose a font
- Responsiveness (should be taken of by tailwind css)

- Adjust scroll snapping (only used in Home.jsx currently)

  - nav bar with scroll snapping is weird --> should disappear as you scroll down but it "sticks"
  - navbar appears more than once if you use other components so have to fix that as well

- In About Us page

  - add box shadow to the 3 columns
  - Carousel should have image previews for left and right

- Add a Hire Us page

  - also link it in the navbar
  - in the about us page, add a link to it as well (either as a button like in their original website or as an a tag)
